### Short description of the project:
- This site is for a "Corporate Sales Trainer". This is made with ReactJS. For more technologies on this site, look down below.
- On the Home page of this site we have a nav-bar section with 3 pages of nav links. Down to the recent section of the nav-bar, we have a Banner section and then a Quote section and then Services and Footer section.
- On the Services page, we have cards of services where a button named "know more" takes you to the checkout page which is protected. That means you have to log in first to go to the checkout page.
- On the blogs page, you will know about the Difference between authorization & authentication and some important things about Firebase.
- And we have an About developer page, where you will know about me as a developer of this site.
- At last, we have a Login page where you will find a form. At the bottom, you will have a Register button if anybody is new to this site.
